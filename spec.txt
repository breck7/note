A Note is an array of bytes/characters(hereafter abbreviated as chars).
This sequence of chars represents a hash table. There are two special
chars in Note which turn an otherwise unstructured linear sequence of
chars into a structured recursive hash table. Those two chars are:

Space char
Keyboard: Space Key
Binary: 00100000
Hex: 20
Decimal: 32

Newline char
Keyboard: Enter Key
Binary: 00001010
Hex: 0A
Decimal: 10

The higher level structures of Note are the two structures of a hash
table: keys and values.

A key is an array of any chars other than Space or Newline. A key is
terminated by a Space or Newline. A key terminated by a Space has a
value of type "array of chars" (string). A key terminated by a Newline
has a value of type Note. A key terminated by an End of File char has
a value of type Note, consisting of an empty Note.

A value is an array of chars (string). Values can contain any char, but
Newline chars must be escaped. To escape a newline char in a value, precede
the Newline char with a Newline char + N Space chars, where N is equal to the number of spaces preceding the key + 1. A value is terminated by an unescaped Newline char. A value can also be terminated by an End of File char.

This is the full spec of Note.
